# e8r

E8R is a series of exensions to [Enumerable](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.1/Enumerable.html)
to expand the contexts in which that approach can be used.

The initial targets are:

* Threads, including thread pools
* Ractors, including ractor pools
* [Async](https://github.com/socketry/async) tasks

> This is currently an experimental project. The names are all arbitrary and
> subject to change.

## Usage

```ruby
gem 'e8r'
```
